					<h2>A good-looking van with so many variants you're bound to find one that fits</h2>
					<p class="description">"Here’s an anniversary you might have missed – 2020 marked a rather incredible 40 years of the Renault Trafic. Yep, the mid-sized van replaced the iconic Estafette way back in 1980 and is still going strong having sold over two million units."</p>
					<p>This current gen arrived in 2014 but was updated around a year ago with new engines, fresh tech and an on-brand Renault family face. Looks rather snazzy these days doesn’t it? Especially in the rather jazzy top-spec Black Edition.</p>
					<p>Oh, and guess how many potential versions of the current Trafic there are? Nope, you’re wrong – it’s around 275. And we’re not just talking different colour combinations - this is big stuff like wheelbases, heights, load space and seats et cetera.</p>
					<p>Impressive right? Basically, if you can’t find a Trafic that works for you, you’re probably not looking hard enough.</p>
					<p>For the panel van, prices start from £29,096 for the least powerful, smallest and most basically trimmed Trafic L1H1 Business. There are then Business+ and Sport trim levels as well as two wheelbase lengths and two roof heights, before you get to the most expensive, most powerful iteration of the L2H1 Black Edition.</p>
					<p>That starts from £39,656 and hopefully gives you an idea of the price ranges we’re looking at here.</p>
					<p>There’s then a crew van with a second row of seats in either long or short wheelbase forms and a poshed-up nine-seat Trafic.</p>
