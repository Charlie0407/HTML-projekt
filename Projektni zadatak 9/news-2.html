					<h2>Did you know the histories of these 12 car badges?</h2>
					<p class="description">"You know what they say about a man with a big estate… No? Well actually, despite the similarity to the male gender symbol, the Volvo logo doesn’t have anything to do with that."</p>
					<p>It uses the chemical symbol for iron to symbolise the ‘strength and power’ of its cars. The company was started by Swedish firm SKF, which made bearings for the automotive industry. Some wag had come up with the Volvo name for the subsidiary, which means ‘I roll’ in Latin.</p>
					<p>Toyota’s logo was only introduced back in 1989 to celebrate the firm’s 80th anniversary. The firm describes its badge as three interlocking ovals, which were designed to be recognisable ‘both head-on and when seen in a rear-view mirror’.</p>
					<p>You might think it’s just a T, but each oval has been designed with a different thickness, tribute to Japan’s calligraphy culture. The overlapping shapes in the middle stand for trust and the outer oval signifies the world embracing Toyota. Even the space in-between is significant, ‘exhibiting the infinite values’ of the company.</p>
					<p>Skoda was founded back in 1859, in what was then the kingdom of Bohemia, now known as the Czech Republic. Known as Skoda Works, it grew to become a massive industrial conglomerate, swallowing up the Laurin-Klement car company in 1924.</p>
					<p>In 1926 Skoda’s car making arm adopted the logo we know today (but in blue) – interpreted in many different ways (chicken in fancy dress, anyone?) but actually representing a Native American headdress, with feathers and an arrow. No, us neither.</p>
					<p>The different parts of the works were hived off after World War 2, the car section now known as Skoda Auto. Volkswagen took over the company in 1991 and swapped the colour to green when the new Felicia was launched in 1993.</p>
