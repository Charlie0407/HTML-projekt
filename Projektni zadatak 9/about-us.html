			<p>Initially, only two trim levels will be offered. Entry-level Life comes with standard kit such as 16in alloy wheels, automatic LED headlights, front and rear parking sensors, ambient lighting and keyless start, as well as a 10.25in digital instrument display and 10.0in touchscreen infotainment system with sat-nav</p>
			<p>Wireless phone charging, a wi-fi hotspot and a three-year subscription to VW’s We Connect Plus services are also thrown in, as is ‘Car-to-X’ technology that will eventually allow the Golf to 'communicate' with road infrastructure and other cars around it.</p>
			<p>The only other trim level for now is Style, which has 17in alloys, adaptive LED 'Plus' headlights, upgraded seats and upholstery, additional ambient lighting, decorative wood inserts and three-zone climate control.</p>
			<p>The initial base price buys a 128bhp four-cylinder 1.5 TSI petrol engine, promising 49.6mpg combined. The 148bhp version is £600 extra and a 113bhp diesel is available from £24,875.</p>
			<p> Style spec starts from £25,470 with the same engine range, although it’s also offered with a 148bhp auto-only (DSG) diesel from £29,170. Prices for the estate have yet to be revealed.</p>
			<p>Further engine variants due in the coming months include a 1.0-litre three-cylinder petrol motor and auto-only mild-hybrid 1.0 and 1.5 petrols. Sportier R-Line variants will arrive soon, too, as a prelude to the launch of the launch of hot GTE, GTI, GTD and R models later in 2020.</p>
			<p>The latest version of the long-running family car – which was first launched in 1974, with more than 35 million sold since – goes on sale in five-door form only with new mild-hybrid engine options and a raft of new digital technology.</p>
